  abstract = {In recent years, there has been a resurgence in developing models and theories for the non-equilibrium behavior of polymeric liquids. The so-called ``tube'' models, gradually refined over decades of research, can now provide a description of the linear and non-linear rheology of entangled polymers that is qualitatively consistent with experiments. Such approaches, however, have been limited to homopolymers. Here we present a general formalism that relies on the concept of slip links to describe the dynamics of high polymers. In this work, it is shown to be capable of describing quantitatively the linear response of pure homopolymers and blends, the non-linear rheology of highly entangled systems, and the dynamics of diblock copolymers.},
